## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) (Cloudflare's command-line tool)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/zenith-ledger.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd zenith-ledger
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies using Bun:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## Development

To run the application in a local development environment, which includes both the Vite frontend server and the Cloudflare Worker for the backend, use the following command:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start the development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. The application will automatically reload upon file changes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

-   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application, including pages, components, hooks, and utility functions.
-   `worker/`: Contains the backend Hono application running on Cloudflare Workers, including API routes and entity logic.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces shared between the frontend and backend to ensure end-to-end type safety.

## Deployment

This project is designed for seamless deployment to the Cloudflare network.

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:**
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```

Wrangler will handle the process of building the application, uploading the assets, and deploying the worker script.
